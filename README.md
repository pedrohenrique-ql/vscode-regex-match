## üöÄ Features

### Test Regular Expressions

Create, test and debug your regex in a text window. To do this, use the standard format with the regex on the first line of the file with the flags required for your case, plus the test string between the text area delimiters (`---`).

### Highlight of Capturing Groups

Each group in a regular expression is highlighted in a different color, making it easy to distinguish and identify them. Color-coded regex capture groups enhance readability and simplify debugging.

### Test Multiple Regular Expressions

You can test multiple regular expressions in the same file. Each regex test works independently, with its own test lines and capture groups. This feature allows you to test different regex patterns in the same place.

### Test Regular Expressions from the Code Editor

Through VS Code's code lens functionality, Regex Match makes it easy to test the regex present in your code. The code lens will appear above the regex, allowing you to test it in Regex Match window.
